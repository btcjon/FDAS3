Goal: use django to display the data from sqlite database located here 'fdas/positions.db' in a table.

1. Check your Django model ( fdas/mainapp/models.py ): Ensure that your Django model correctly represents the structure of your SQLite database. Each field in your database table should have a corresponding field in your Django model.

2. Check your Django view ( fdas/mainapp/views.py ): Your view function should fetch all records from your model and return them as JSON. This can be done using Django's JsonResponse function.

3. Check your URL configuration ( fdas/fdas/urls.py ): Make sure you've configured a URL for your view function. This URL is what your JavaScript code will send a request to.

4. Check your JavaScript code ( fdas/mainapp/templates/index.html ): Your JavaScript code should send an AJAX request to the URL you configured for your view function, and then update the page with the response. You can use jQuery's $.get function to send the AJAX request.

5. Check your database connection ( fdas/fdas/settings.py ): Ensure that you've correctly configured the connection to your SQLite database in your Django settings.

6. Check your HTML template ( fdas/mainapp/templates/index.html ): Your HTML template should contain a table or other HTML element that your JavaScript code can insert the data into.
